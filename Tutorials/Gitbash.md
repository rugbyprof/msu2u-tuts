In this section we will discuss briefly what Git is and delve into Bash and Gitbash.

###Git
_____
Git is a distributed version control system. Version control of software is a method used to track incremental changes in software which in turn allows for easier rollbacks, issue tracking, feature addition etc. In other words it makes following the progress of the development of a piece of software worlds easier. The distributed part refers to the fact that the changes that are being tracked in a project are not kept in one place but are distributed over every computer that has a copy of the repository with the software and is running Git. Going forward from here I will assume that everyone already has a an account with Github, which is a social programming and repository hosting service.
